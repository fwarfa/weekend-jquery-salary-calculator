TODO LIST
[ ] input form that collects:
    [ ] employee first name, last name, ID number, job title, annual salary.
[ ] A 'Submit' button should:
    [ ] collect the form information
    [ ] store the information to calculate monthly costs
    [ ] append information to the DOM
    [ ] clear the input fields
[ ] Using the stored information, calculate monthly costs
[ ] and append this to the to DOM
[ ] If the total monthly cost exceeds $20,000, add a red background color
    to the total monthly cost
[ ] Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM
    (For base mode, does not need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total)

STRETCH MODE 
[ ] Add styling or extra functionality that fits with the theme of this assignment.
[ ] Once the employee is deleted, update the total spend on salaries account for this employee's removal. 
    This will require that the logic knows which element was removed. 
    You will need to use .text() as a getter or look into jQuery's .data() function.
    This is tricky!
